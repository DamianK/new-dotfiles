My New Dotfiles (replaces old dotfiles repo)

These are the configurations and scripts I'm using in my laptop (macOS) and my desktop Manjaro Linux (Arch) and Windows+WSL(Ubuntu 22.04).
Main development environment includes Alacritty, Zellij and NeoVim.
PLEASE NOTE: This is very much a work in progress! I'm upgrading my PC at the moment so most things will change!
