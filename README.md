My New Dotfiles (updated October 6, 2025)

These are the configurations and scripts I'm using in my laptop (macOS) and my desktop (now mac also).
Main development environment currently includes now includes WezTerm, Termius, VSCode and NeoVim. On mac I also use Aerospace as my Tiling Window Manager.
